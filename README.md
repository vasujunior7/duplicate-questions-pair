# Duplicate Questions Pair - Quora

## Overview

This project aims to determine whether two given questions from Quora are duplicates or not. It leverages various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features that help in measuring textual similarity. The extracted features are then used to train a machine learning model for classification.

## Features Extracted

The project computes multiple similarity features between two input questions (`q1` and `q2`), including:

### Token-based Features
- **Word Overlap Ratio**: Measures how many words are common between the two questions.
- **Unique Words Count**: Computes the number of unique words in each question.
- **Stopword Ratio**: Calculates the proportion of stopwords in each question.

### String Matching Features
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Computes the edit distance between two questions.
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measures the intersection over union of word sets.
- **Fuzzy Matching Scores**: Utilizes fuzzy string matching to determine similarity.

### Vector-based Features
- **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Computes the cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors.
- **Word2Vec Similarity**: Uses pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings to determine semantic similarity.
- **Sentence Embeddings**: Leverages transformer-based models (BERT, Sentence-BERT) for contextual similarity.

## Data Format

The input dataset consists of the following columns:
- **question1**: First question text.
- **question2**: Second question text.
- **is_duplicate**: Target label (1 if duplicate, 0 otherwise).

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasujunior7/duplicate-questions-pair.git
cd duplicate-questions-pair
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Feature Extraction

Run the feature extraction script to convert the question pairs into feature vectors:

```bash
python feature_extraction.py --input data/quora_pairs.csv --output features.csv
```

### Step 2: Train the Model

Train the machine learning model using the extracted features:

```bash
python train_model.py --features features.csv --output model.pkl
```

### Step 3: Test on New Data

Once the model is trained, you can test it on new question pairs:

```bash
python predict.py --model model.pkl --input test_data.csv
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

1. **Input Format Errors**:
   - Ensure that the input questions are properly formatted before feature extraction. Missing or malformed data can lead to errors during the feature extraction process.
   
2. **Tokenization Issues**:
   - Inconsistent tokenization or punctuation in the questions might affect the feature extraction. Double-check the preprocessing steps, and ensure that all necessary cleaning (such as removing special characters) is done.

3. **Missing Values**:
   - Check for missing values in your dataset (especially in the `question1`, `question2`, or `is_duplicate` columns). Missing or incomplete rows could cause errors when generating feature vectors or training the model.

4. **Feature Extraction Output**:
   - Verify the feature extraction output to ensure that the similarity scores are computed correctly. If the output is unexpected, consider re-checking the features and the underlying extraction logic.

## Future Improvements

The following improvements could enhance the accuracy and robustness of this project:

- **Integrate Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa)** for better semantic understanding.
- **Implement adversarial data augmentation** to improve robustness against diverse question pairs.
- **Optimize feature engineering** by applying dimensionality reduction techniques (such as PCA or t-SNE) to reduce the feature space while preserving important information.
